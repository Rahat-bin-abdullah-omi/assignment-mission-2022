            <p>When people make a mistake, it is nice to give them advice, but… if they don't listen, just leave them alone. Otherwise, you'll do yourself a disservice by wasting your time and effort. No matter how messed up things get, you can always figure out the best solution.</p>

                <p>My name is Ashraful and I'm 17. People on the internet calls me Ash but I usally go with the alias "Hogor". Once upon a time I used to have ambition and dreams. I had a lot of hobbies like singing and drawing, but I lost faith in humanity long time ago. Right now I'm still alive for the sake of my mom and my sister. I know I shouldn't be saying about my personal stuff on the assignment, But I really don't know what to add as it is my first time. So Enjoy this sketch from ATTACK ON TITAN that I made. Also, I'm sorry for the trouble but I really enjoy rickrolling people sometimes.</p>
